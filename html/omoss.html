                <h3>How did we get here</h3>
                <p>We started our discgolf journey as just 3 friends playing rounds and tournaments. We got passionate really fast and this meant that we started
                    noticing the importance of the equipment. We noticed especially that regular shoes or sport shoes did start to fall apart on a quite fast pace.</p>

                <p>So this is when we started reasearching different type of shoes and which of them will hold the best while playing discgolf. After some time we came to a conclusion that a full understanding of which shoes will handle the playing best has not even been found fully yet.
                    This is when the first idea of a shop for discgolf shoes only started to find it's way out.</p>

                <p>Now our online shop handles all your needs within the discgolf footwear, it can be everything from shopping your next pair of shoes or many of footwear accessories or if it is just to do your research about the diffent shoe types
                    and in which playing style or terrain they hold the best amount of time.</p>
